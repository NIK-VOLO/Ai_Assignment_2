CURRENT:
- Come up with heuristics:
      --> Distance to Enemy pieces
      --> Sum of Distances



COMPLETE:
- Make a method in grid to make string board from current grid state --> pass string board to alphabeta()
  - Create game states from possible moves (String board)
    - Create children (string board) of current game state
- Update actual board based on string board
